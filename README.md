# 👋 Hi, I'm Dmytro Melnyk

I'm a backend developer passionate about building scalable services, automation tools, and bots that make life easier. With hands-on experience in creating clean and maintainable microservice-based architectures, I love working with Python and exploring integrations with APIs and external systems. Occasionally, I dabble in frontend work with basic React and layouting.
